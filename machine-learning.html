			<h1>Machine Learning</h1>
			<p>Machine learning also known as AI(Artificial Intelligence) is the process of making a program which adapts to the way it’s used, for example autocorrect is a form of machine learning were the program compares commonly used words to words being entered it also recommends words before being entered , all of this is done based on the users previous inputs and the most commonly used words for the corresponding user, this information is collected and stored for later references then once enough data is stored the program compares the data to find the most commonly used phrases and word storage by the user.</p>
<p>Machine learning is a constantly developing technology, the state of the art for this technology is a wide subject as machine learning can be categorised into both supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms and within these two categories machine learning can function in different ways such as the effects of machine learning within voice assistant technology such as apple's siri or amazon's alexa where as another instance in which machine learning may differ is through the usage of graphical recognition software such as facial recognition or iris recognition.</p>
<p>Supervised machine learning is when you have a user input stored and a prediction made for the output based on the previous results of the machine, the functionality of supervised machine learning is ended once the machine or program reaches a satisfactory ratio of correct output predictions and is able to re-use the collected data.</p>
<p>Unsupervised machine learning is when you have input data but do not create an output based on that data but instead use that data as a measurement for comparison as there is no correct answer to this data as this data is used to create recommendations for example the data a customer creates from looking at products can be compared to similar product data to generate what advertisements a customer may be interested in.</p>
<p>In this current time machine learning is used for small things such as auto correction functions, advertisement filtering and data collection but is also used for much larger programs such as automated response systems and graphic recognition software.</p>
<p>Within the next 3 years machine learning is likely to advanced greatly particularly in the medical industry with machines which are beginning to predict a patient's death date based off health history and more, according to Forbes the results of this testing reached a 95% accuracy, more can be found in this Forbes article here: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2018/07/23/three-ai-and-machine-learning-predictions-for-2019/#593f34124948" target="_blank">https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2018/07/23/three-ai-and-machine-learning-predictions-for-2019/#593f34124948</a>.</p>
<p>Machine learning is becoming the future as it allows our applications that are already accurate  to become more and more accurate and provide faster data analysis as it provides data which enhances our algorithms as we can isolate potential solutions with the extra data created via machine learning for example rather then having 10,000 potential solutions we can quickly re-evaluate our options to searching/generating a smaller array of potentially 1,000 or less solutions as we can predict what the user is attempting to do and find a solution faster.</p>
<p>A potential use for machine learning is interpreting slang phrases for voice activation as once the slang is recognized verbally it can interpret things as certain meanings and depending on the data collected it can eventually find the context the slang is used in as well as variations of the particular slang and in what situations it is more commonly used for example a check on potential slang usage in Australia against the uk and what is more commonly used in context there compared to Australia to find the most accurate description.</p>

<h3>What is the likely impact? </h3>
<p>The likely impact of machine learning is a constantly evolving society as it removes the previous limits to what we could create through programming even though most the algorithms used were taken from previous algorithms in the 80’s or 90’s and improved on, as technology becomes more advanced machine learning is playing a larger part the further it progresses as machine learning allows us to reach places not humanly possible via the calculations that machine learning inherits from its data collection the likely impact of this is reducing the amount of work required for certain jobs for example engineering plan creation eventually until the point that machine learning will be able to adapt the most efficient design plans for the situation , in doing this however it will also create a larger pool of jobs for IT based roles as creating new algorithms and analysing the data presented will always need tweaking as technology will consistently move forward, Many of the technologies in place today may also be made created in newer fashions which will optimize the way concepts work for example the way a vr system recognises hand controllers due to machine learning will eventually be able to recognize common movements when attempting to do specific tasks then from there be able to create a smoother system.</p>
<p>The Changes in technology will affect most people as machine learning can reshape society based off the degree of implementation associated with machine learning as this has the potential to predict common practice results with a high accuracy to project an outcome or increase productivity with the associated technology this also has the potential to dramatically increase the amount of jobs in society or dramatically reduce them dependant on the technology which machine learning is introduced into and how it has been introduced into it.</p>

<h3>In your daily life</h3>
<p>Within daily life machine learning will make the technology we use on the daily more efficient , your lights will turn off after a certain amount of time, tv’s will track commonly watched channels at certain times, possibly even commonly watched shows of the user, online shopping will be able to create lists of things the user commonly purchases after x amount of time, the list goes on in short machine learning will automate most commonly used things within day to day life if not fully automated it will as a minimum provide as a minimum a partial suggestion requiring user input.</p>
<p>As machine learning progresses not only programs but also robotics work may also progress as this will allow more machines to replicate human jobs , machine learning development is a process which affects every person since the technology once implemented will indefinitely provide better results and slowly become something which we adapt into our daily lives more and more, for example take phones and the applications on them, go back 20 years and not nearly as many people rely on the applications within their phone , these applications have had the adaption of machine learning upon the technology they already possess and in turn with these changes has made the doing things in other ways seem stupid as using a mobile device 
May make these small tasks much faster to perform or process even the way we use security features on these devices from entering passwords to secure phones to the current times of facial and fingerprint recognition.</p>
<p>Machine learning is also highly valued by larger companies as this can potential allow large companies to save thousands if not millions of dollars particularly with large data collection in order to recognize what products there potential audiences will be interested in in short the way that machine learning evolves in unpredictable and depending on what is created it can affect everyone as technology has been integrated highly into modern society and machine learning greatly affects how we use these technologies.</p>
