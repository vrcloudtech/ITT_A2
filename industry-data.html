			<h2>How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h2>
			<p>The demand for the skills identified within the Burning Glass data appear evenly spread. Compared to each team member’s ideal jobs, JAVA/JavaScript and Microsoft Office experience were the most common prerequisite. It is difficult to determine whether this is a result of an even spread of work across the IT field, a lack of technical knowledge for each position thus creating blanket skill requests, or a mixture of both with a demand for basic technical knowledge in SQL, web design and business acumen.</p>
			<p>What is interesting about the top 20 skills identified in the Burning Glass data is that Management skills are noted twice, as well as relationship building. Although not specifically technology related, it highlights that recruiters are looking for employees that can offer more than just technical know-how.</p>

			<h2>How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h2>
			<p>The results from the tally appear to accurately reflect the demand for the skills amongst recruiters and potential employers identified within each member’s ideal job descriptions and job requirements.</p>
			<p>The Burning Glass results list 'Communication Skills’, 'Problem Solving' and 'Organisational Skills' as the top three preferred skills respectively.</p>
			<p>In comparison between everyone’s ideal jobs, 'Communication Skills', 'Problem Solving' and 'Time Management' came in as the most common skill set amongst the four team members.</p>
			<p>It is not surprising that 'Communication Skills' came in as a common requirement amongst each ideal job. Having good verbal and written communication skills not only allows each member to effectively communicate with each other, but allows an individual to interpret, assess and then relay important information to others more efficiently. Having good communication skills also allows an individual to relay only the important or required information, filtering the unnecessary and the redundant.</p>

			<h2>What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set?</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>SAP</li>
				<li>Business Management</li>
				<li>Building Relationships</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Building effective relationships</li>
				<li>Articulate</li>
				<li>Self-starter</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</h2>
			<p>A general consensus amongst team members is that these results have no impact on each other’s ideal jobs.</p>
			<p>The most common feedback was that the results only highlight the areas of weaknesses or areas that each member needs to focus more attention too.</p>
			<p>Some feedback from members included:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Bruno Fonesca - "No, my ideal job has pretty much been the same since I was a child"</li>
				<li>Oscar Herrick commented "My skill set is in high demand... [Therefore] my opinion has not changed"</li>
				<li>Kyle Samuels - "Management is my current profession. I am studying I.T. to stay ahead in an industry that lacks the necessary adaption rate of technology to stay relevant. My ideal job is a bridge between these two skill sets and seeing management as an in-demand IT skill as well as programming languages relevant to my ideal role are just as high in demand. These results further reinforce my previous expectations with this ideal job and it as a career pathway."</li>
				<li>Ben Lister – “My ideal job is easily adaptable across industries and will be always be of high demand. These results assure me that software engineering is my ideal job.”</li>
