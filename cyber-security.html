			<h1>Cyber Security</h1>
			<h3>What does it do?</h3>
<p>Cyber security is technology which prevents data access to those who are not prohibited to view such data, such as database information,code or need to know information for government agencies which may be a security risk if exposed.</p>
<p>At the current time even the most state of the art cyber security is exploitable with enough man power and time however,to maintain top cybersecurity for technologically stored data cyber security practices should be implemented where possible, cyber security practices may include but are not limited to things as basic as ensuring that your are using an antivirus and firewall to things more complex such as penetration testing,encryption and user verification procedures which may include verifications texts or account login emails.</p>
<p>As of 22 of february 2018 the australian government implemented a NDB(Notifiable Data Breach) Scheme which obligates organisations to notify individuals of potential data breaches and conduct assessment of any data breaches or suspected data breaches which may cause harm due to data breach or leakage, the notification off an organisation involved in the data breach must also provide recommendations to avoid further damage due to the data breach, more information in relation to this scheme can be found here<a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy-law/privacy-act/notifiable-data-breaches-scheme#overview" target="_blank"> https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy-law/privacy-act/notifiable-data-breaches-scheme#overview.</a></p>
<p>The NDB Scheme in itself is a form of cyber security although this scheme does also provide incentive for organisations and companies to maintain good cyber security practices in order to prevent a negative image on the company as even the best cyber security practices will simply delay data breaches however the data store with good security practices will highly discourage ‘hackers’ or potential Problems for stored data to ‘not be worth their time’ as for very Good cyber security practices breaching this data could potentially take years and if the cyber security practices are constantly updated over time the process of breaching this data will take even longer.</p>
<p>In the next 3 years or so cyber security will become a much more common practice because of the recognition of how important these practices are in modern society and as technology advances , even the most basic forms of functionality within society are becoming more and more digitized for instance take currency slowly “cash” is being phased out through society as more and more people are moving on to using debit cards and crypto based currencies.</p>
<p>At the current point in time technology is everywhere , if you were to list what you use in everyday living in this day and age the majority of appliances would be revolving around IT based technologies which and more and more commonly are being connected to data servers or cloud computing Systems for example many households now use smart tv’s, smart tv’s generally have access to the internet if not for movies or tv streaming services as a minimum update servers, whilst the data contained in a smart tv may seem harmless things such as user names , emails, passwords, security questions, phone numbers, without even touching on billing information if breached can usually be used to access a variety of recovery options for other accounts which can lead to further data breaches, if any of this data is similar to or connected to other services, this can provide a large amount of problems and damages for both users and organisations.</p>
<p>Technology is always advancing and as new functionality and ideas emerge so do exploits in the advancements that come out of new technology as cyber security is a constantly evolving method of preventing unwanted data intrusions from gaining access this can be a 2 way street as there is always people who are attempting to access the data that is being protected by cyber security.</p>

<h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
<p>This development is ever changing as the impact of poor cyber security is can bring organisations to a complete stop as usually the data which is being protected will have a significant impact on the users, this impact may vary depending on the organisation however most details contained in web server storage is private information of customers from names to email addresses to credit card information , Cyber security is a technology which will create an expanding number of IT based jobs since this is an ever expanding role as new technology is created.</p>
<p>Throughout history there have been many data breaches for example the playstation network had a huge data breach in 2011 as a result of this data breach sony estimated a 171million dollars including costs to fix the data breach however they had also lost a fiscal year profit of 3.18 billion due the the after effects of a lack of cyber security.</p>
<p>When it comes to technology and improving technology in this day and age there is no point in developing good software which harbours data without good cyber security practices in place as you can see from the above example of sony and there large data breach the implementations of not just cybersecurity but of constantly updated cyber security can be quite dramatic for an organisation since not only will this cost additional funding from the company to fix the data breach access methods or procedures taken but also provokes a lot of additional damage to the organisation yearly profit and reputation, not to mention the personal details being stored by the organisation however data breaches are not just limited to companies as a data breach can be from a result of information entered into phishing attempts or other “scams” created to find a person or organisations sensitive data.</p>

<h3>How will this Affect you?</h3>
<p>In daily life this will affect me as if an organisation loses my personal details whether it be billing or even personal details such as login information it can create problems such as credit card fraud and identity theft the lack of cyber security will also affect any other members which the data is involved with for example if an Instant messaging website had chat logs and someone had to lend u account details for reasons unknown , for example to administer a web server then the details enter into messages for that additional data will also be breached and can lead to additional problems for both organisations and personal in terms of damage financially and legally.</p>
<p>The repercussions of poor cyber security affect everyone who may have potential connections to the affected organisation.</p>
<p>As well as organisations having data breaches occur this also can happen to personnel who do not use cyber security measures for usernames or passwords an example of this is someone setting the password for their account to password or other generally used passwords, another example is a person setting there security questions as there security answers, etc.</p>
<p>Cyber security measures are in place to prevent data breaches however in most cases this also requires user collaboration since most users will tend to get lazy when cyber security measures cannot be enforced such as the use of authenticators or other methods of validation which ensures the correct user data belongs to the user who is accessing that data, occasionally users may give out this data without knowledge of doing so such as the means of rats or phishing however in modern times these types of data breaches are far less common due to the fact of improved cybersecurity being inbuilt into most OS kernels and constantly being updated such as windows defender, as well as additional choices of personal cyber security which can be found online such as malwarebytes anti rootkit tool which can be located here: <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/antirootkit/" target="_blank">https://www.malwarebytes.com/antirootkit/</a> this type of protection provides us with a personal level of cyber security.</p>
