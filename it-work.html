<p class="question">Question 1: What kind of work is done by the I.T. professional?</p>
<p class="response">“my day to day involves pretty much IT support for KANE, so site set up, any hardware, any routers, any printers go through me. New staff members, creating emails, any accounts, JOBPAC [accounting software], the intranet I have to make, so everyone new in the company goes through me."</p>
<p class="question">Question 2: What kind of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general Public?</p>
<p class="response">“Think solutions, which is our [KANE Constructions] external IT provider. They manage the back end, whether it be the servers; anything that goes down, anything big like our servers. Our phone systems, if those go down, we usually give it to them cause they are a bigger company and have more experience."</p>
<p class="question interim">Interim additional question asked: What are the levels of IT knowledge or experience amongst the people you deal with?</p>
<p class="response">“With our outsourced IT company... they do have level 1, level 2 an level 3 that we deal with. Level 1 is support, level 2 get escalated from level 1 if it becomes to difficult, and level 3 is final resort. They’re the top guns who know pretty much everything."</p> 
<p class="question">Continuation of Question 2:</p>
<p class="response">“Investors, we don’t talk about investors. We do talk to our vendors. Dell, Ricoh. Who supply us with gear.”</p>
<p class="question interim">Interim additional question: If [KANE Constructions] were looking at potential software upgrades, would the directors request feedback from yourself?</p>
<p class="response">“Yes we would have input, we would. Usually they would ask us the Pros & Cons of it and we will have to do the digging and get back to them with what we think. If it is viable for the company.“</p>
<p class="question interim">Interim additional questions: Do you go through a cost analysis of the programme itself?</p>
<p class="response">"Yes, usually we do."</p>
<p class="question">Question 3: Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</p>
<p class="response">"In the office, in front of the computer. I do spend time in the comms room, if i have to patch some cables, patch some ports in."</p>
<p class="question">Question 4: What aspect of your position is the most challenging?</p>
<p class="response">"I would say, time management. In my position, its only me dealing with the day to day business. With how big our company is, for everything to go through one person, you have to manage your time right. You have to put more important things on top.”</p>
<p class="question interim">Interim additional question: What would you list as your top three IT specific skills you have taken away from your three years of study?</p>
<p class="response">“In uni, you have to work in teams. Thats the first one, you have to be able to work with other people."</p>
<p class="response">"Be able to hold a conversation with people. I do know coding, python and JAVA.”</p>

<p class="question">Question from Ben Lister:</p>
<p class="question">Are there any IT pressures that make work limiting i.e could have xyz system instead of xxx system to improve efficiencies?</p>
<p class="response">"Well, I will put for example our company, KANE. We have servers on site, and we have to connect it to the VPN to get back to the head office. Why isn’t there an all in one system that does VPN, internet, On-Site, we have looked into that. There are tons of options out there, but price is always an issue.”</p>
