			<h3>Kyle <i>“The Commander”</i> Samuels</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Rational, intelligent, intuitive, strategic.</li> 
				<li>Recorded highly in both visual and kinesthetic learning styles.</li>
				<li>Confident in his own abilities, his self proclaimed stubbornness from his own assessment can sometimes get him into situations that reasoned discussions could have avoided.</li>
				<li>Not swayed by conflict or confrontations, is happy to make difficult decisions.</li>
				<li>Very team orientated with a single goal of ensuring the overall team objective is met.</li>
				<li>Strong self confidence, but this can lead to a sense of arrogance and a lack of empathy for those that do not agree with the teams primary goals</li>

			<h3>Ty <i>“The Duty Fulfiller”</i> Church</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>		Auditory, equally happy as an introvert or extrovert, thorough and responsible. Very organized, strong work ethic and goal orientated.
				</li><li>From self assessment of ‘Learning Styles’ test, Ty believes his best chance at comprehending the information for this assignment is through verbal discussions
				</li><li>Serious in nature with strong concentration skills but can only focus his mind on a single task at a time. The ability to give his all to a task is definitely beneficial to the team for assignment 2. 
				</li><li>Conflicting results between Myers-Briggs test and Big Five test except for emotional awareness of other members.
				</li><li>Potential leader qualities if he can remain critical of his own actions

			<h3>Ben <i>“The Architect”</i> Lister</h3>
			<ul>

				<li>Visual learner, ‘think outside the box’ mentality, organized and driven. Prefers the quiet and avoids conflict if it is achievable. Empathetic and conscientious of the team members.
				</li>
				<li>From self assessment of ‘The Big 5 Personality’ test, Ben acknowledges his very low score on Neuroticism (negative emotion triggers) - the trait that can be associated to feelings such as anxiety, anger, envy or guilt. The neuroticism trait in a team assignment would be counter-productive, especially being distant learners as this may create a divide amongst team members who are already geographically challenged. </li>
				<li>After reflecting on results, Ben admits to being a self-proclaimed ‘closet-introvert’ and that he will need to work hard to be more open with his team members

			<h3>Bruno <i>“The Adventurer”</i> Fonseca</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Tactile (kinesthetic) learner, feels very strongly about the interests and needs of others before himself, objective based mentality.</li>
				<li>Critical of his learning style and how it applies to online team-based studies, noting difficulty in retaining focus during periods of reading or writing.</li>
				<li>Classified as “The Adventurer” by www.16personalities.com, Bruno is creative and has strong control over his emotional health. Bruno acknowledges he enjoys being social and will avoid conflicts. On projects with greater worth and impact, this self-conscious need to remain everyone’s friend could be considered a weakness to those in power above him, especially when a decision worthy of his experience is to be made.
