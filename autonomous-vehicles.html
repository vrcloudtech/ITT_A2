		<h1>Autonomous Vehicles</h1>	
<p>Experiments on automating our driving or transport have been conducted since the 1920s, with trials first beginning in the 1950s. The first semi-autonomous car was designed and built in Japan during 1977 by Tsukuba Mechanical Engineering Laboratory. However, it wasn’t until the 1980s that the first true autonomous vehicles started appearing due to Mercedes-Benz and DARPA funding various university projects. In 2015, popular US states California, Florida, Washington D.C., Nevada, Virginia and Michigan allowed the testing of autonomous vehicles on certain public roads.</p>
<h3>What does it do?</h3>
<p>Autonomous vehicles use the latest technology in sensory information processing to move and navigate the environment with little or no human input. They use cutting edge technologies which include but are not limited to sonar, radar, lidar and GPS. Various self-driving systems have been developed by major technology and automaker companies such as Google, Tesla, Uber and Mercedes-Benz. Uber’s systems use 64 laser beams along with sensors to plot an internal map. Google has used lasers, radar, sonar and high powered cameras at different stages.</p>
<p>The software in these cars processes the inputs from the sensors and creates a map of the environment. From this map the system sends the information to the vehicles ‘actuators’ which control the acceleration, braking and steering. Semi-autonomous vehicles require a human driver to intervene at certain situations or if the system encounters uncertainty. Hard-coded road rules, obstacle avoidance algorithms, predictive modelling and the ability to distinguish a bicycle from a motorcycle all help the car navigate the terrain and reach its destination.</p>
<p>While these vehicles are most certainly the future of our transportation, we are likely many years from seeing self-driving cars become as popular as standard cars. The automotive industry has a large quantity of government regulations and constraints to deal with. However, according to industry estimates, in 2020 the autonomous vehicle market will be worth US$87 billion. It is predicted that by 2040, four out of every 10 vehicles on the road will be fully-autonomous, with long distance trucks taking the forefront of this technology. </p>
<p>Out of the 5 levels of autonomy, we are currently sitting on level 3, which is conditional autonomy. This means the car can manage most of the safety functions and maintain itself inside its lane, but still needs to driver to remain alert and take over when needed. Ford is promising to have a Level 4 autonomous car ready by 2021. This is one step short of full autonomy as it still requires a pre-mapped environment/path to take, but apparently it will not have a steering wheel nor gas pedals as driving along this path will be fully-autonomous. The benefit to this is if a company always takes the same route to do its deliveries it will now be automated. In the same sense, if someone always takes the same route to work, this route could be mapped and automated.</p>
<p>Augmented reality (AR) is a new technology that is already being used worldwide in many vehicles. It has the ability to overlay critical information on the windshield of the car, allowing drivers to keep their eyes on the road rather than gauges or infotainment screens. Future advancements of AR will likely see real-time content be placed or overlaid with the drivers view of the road, such as navigation prompts or warning signs. As autonomous vehicles become more prominent, AR will serve to show the passengers what the self-driving car sees, displaying relevant information in suitable locations around the cabin.</p>

<h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
<p>The overwhelming impact of this technology will be the increased safety. Over 1.3 million people are killed annually on public roads around the globe with several more millions severely injured. Most of these accidents are caused by human error, alcohol abuse, speeding and simply being distracted. Autonomous vehicles are estimated to save over 1 million lives a year because these causes will no longer be an issue. With software being less prone to error than humans, cyber security will still remain a big concern.</p>
<p>The convenience of being able to sit inside the moving vehicle which will drive you to work without the need of any input is astounding. Whilst many people enjoy driving and see it as a pleasurable activity, having to spend many hours on a commute to work in traffic is neither fun nor productive. Autonomous vehicles will allow us to take the time we would normally spend driving to work and use it more productively. Each autonomous vehicle will also navigate more efficiently, reaching the destination in less time which reduces transport times in general.  They will all be connected and be able to communicate to each other, coordinating their intentions so fewer traffic jams occur.</p>
<p>Autonomy of our vehicles will help mobilize individuals who are unable to drive themselves, such as the elderly or disabled. But will also displace millions of people who are employed as drivers or chauffers. Luckily most of the autonomous vehicles are already either fully electric or have some kind of hybrid system installed. This will reduce the environmental impacts considerably as mobilizing a wider range of the population might equal more vehicles on the road.</p>

<h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
<p>I am passionate about cars and can see myself pursuing a career in the automotive industry, so this could only possibly affect me positively. My father is a retired mechanic who fixed cars and bikes for about 50 years, so I know a little about the mechanical side of the vehicles. However, what interests me more is the technology side of the cars, the computer systems within or electronic control units (ECUs).</p> 
<p>The increasing numbers of autonomous vehicles are only opening up more job opportunities. The computer systems within these cars are constantly changing and adopting new technologies. I would love to work with one of the companies doing research, coding and manufacturing these machines. Being able to not only watch my code/work come to life, but also being able to sit inside the vehicle and experience it will be satisfying.</p>
<p>Nothing will be much different for me or my friends or family because we don’t drive for a living. These advancements will only make our transportation easier and less of a burden. Hopefully manually driving a car will never cease to exist as we all love to drive on weekends to beautiful places. Having the autonomy during a work week would be perfect, but hopefully a part of the road will be left for the manually-driving car enthusiasts to enjoy a drive.</p>
