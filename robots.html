			<h1>Robots</h1>
			<p>Robots are man-made programmable machines, capable of performing actions that are usually performed by humans, autonomously or semi-autonomously. In 1948, the first practical robot concept was formulated by Norbert Wiener, an American mathematician and philosopher. He is credited as being one of the first to theorize that all intelligent behavior is a result of feedback mechanisms, which could be programmed into machines. This marked the beginnings of modern AI.</p> 
<p>Robotics is a large branch of technology that deals with designing, manufacturing, operating and maintaining robots, as well as the computer systems that control each robot, their sensory feedback and information processing. Every robot is a mechanical construction of some shape or form that has electrical components to power and control the machinery. All robots also contain some level of programming code which is where the intelligence comes from.</p>

<h3>What does it do?</h3>
<p>The state of the art of this technology is in the humanoid robots Atlas and Sophia. Unveiled in 2013, Atlas is an agile humanoid machine from Boston Dynamics, that can climb, run, jump and backflip, it can do parkour and pick up objects. It is 1.5 metres high, weighs 75 kilograms and has the capability of lifting 11 kilograms, which is considered a compact robot with high strength-to-weight ratio. It can keep its balance if pushed and even stands back up upon tipping over. Its control system achieves this coordination using its 28 joints, hydraulic actuation, battery power and LiDAR and Stereo vision. LiDAR vision is exactly the same as radar, differing only in emitting light waves instead of radio waves.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Sophia is a social humanoid robot designed and developed by Hong Kong based company Hanson Robotics.  Instead of displaying movement and weight carrying abilities, it has its own humanoid face capable of displaying more than 50 facial expressions. First activated in February 14, 2016, it is capable of having in-depth conversations with human beings. Artificial intelligence, visual data processing and facial recognition are among some of the technologies implemented into this robot that allows it to interact with us. It uses “speech-to-text” voice recognition technology from the parent company of Google, Alphabet Inc. The AI in Sophia analyses the conversations, storing and extracting data which will allow it to improve future responses. In January 2018, Sophia was upgraded with functional legs and the ability to walk.</p>
<p>I can’t help but imagine the robot we could create if we merged Atlas’s movement and physical abilities with Sophia’s AI, recognition and social abilities. In the past, robots were programmed to follow a certain path, or a ‘map’ was included so the robots knew what was in their surrounding environment and how to react in certain places. Our technology has advanced beyond this restriction and now robots can navigate unmapped environments, and think for themselves. Robots are becoming more intelligent and more autonomous every year.</p>
<p>In 2015, the International Federation of Robotics (IFR) released a report stating the total number of industrial robots in the world is about 1.5 million. This year in 2019, those numbers have increased to approximately 2.6 million units. That is about 1 million more robotic units in only 4 years. About 70% of those units work in the automotive, electrical and metal industries.</p>
<p>In the next 3 years robots are expected to almost double in population, from about 2.6 million to over 4 million in 2022. The media and wider public will continue to share the same doom stories about the “rise of the robots/machines”, while the robotics industry will continue to grow and improve their technologies for the benefit of mankind. </p>

<h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
<p>It is extremely unlikely that within the next 50 years robots will replace many jobs. So far an increase of robots has had a positive effect on employment numbers as humans are required to work alongside them. The robots are more efficient and increase productivity, but they require maintenance and support. The reduced production costs for the companies result in better market prices which increases demand. The increased demand then opens more job opportunities. This is confirmed in a recent study published by the ZEW, in partnership with the University of Utrecht.</p>
<p>However, there are a few jobs that will start being replaced earlier than others. Chauffers, truck drivers, basically anyone who drives for a living will have the livelihood disrupted in the 15 – 25 year time frame. Chefs, waiters, cashiers, office clerks are also all amongst the most risky and will likely be automated in the near future. Any job that has a standard procedure or routine that can be automated will be automated. Financial analysts, similar to lawyers, will also be taking a hit as computers can spot patterns and make trades faster than even the most eagle-eyed human analysts.</p>
<p>Social interaction employment such as a teacher, sales rep, general manager or nurse is perfectly safe for at least the next half century. These require connecting with fellow human beings which Sophia has only just touched the surface. The wide range of specific conditions needed in order to function properly renders the robots brittle and fragile, particularly when compared to the robust adaptability of human beings.</p>

<h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
<p>Advances in robots and robotics in general will be a positive thing in my life. I aspire to be a software engineer and every single robot has some form of code written into it. Robots are created to efficiently complete our mundane tasks so we have more time for the important stuff. All those chores that need to be completed upon arriving home after a long day of work will already be done, allowing us to focus on our work and leisure. I believe I will find great enjoyment in coding all the different types of machines and watching them come to life.</p>
<p>Many people will find hardship in losing their jobs or getting replaced, but new jobs will be created and new opportunities will arise. Overall the quality of life will be improved as more robots are developed and new technologies are implemented.</p>
